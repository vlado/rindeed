= Rindeed

Rindeed is something like a wrapper around Indeed Web Services (XML interface).

You can find more info about Indeed Web Services at:

  http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp
  http://www.indeed.com/jsp/xmlsample.jsp

Rindeed depends on <b>hpricot</b> http://github.com/why/hpricot and <b>will_paginate</b> http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate

== Installation

  $ ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/vlado/rindeed.git

After install you must set your publisher id and you can also set some default options that will be used in all searches.
Good place to place this could be ApplicationController

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    Rindeed.publisher_id = "yourpublisherid"
    Rindeed.default_options(:chnl => "mysite", :limit => 30)
  end

== Examples

=== Simple search

  ExampleController < ActionController::Base

    def list_ruby_jobs_in_ny_area
      @jobs = Rindeed.find("ruby", "ny")
    end

    def indeed_search
      @jobs = Rindeed.find(params[:what], params[:where], :sort => "date", :limit => 20)
    end

  end

=== Pagination

Pagination is implemented using mislav's will_paginate, and it should be pretty straightforward

First call pagination in your controller

  ExampleController < ActionController::Base

    def indeed_search
      @jobs = Rindeed.paginate(params[:what], params[:where], :page => params[:page] || 1)
    end

  end

and then you can do this in your view

  <h2>My jobs from Indeed</h2>
  
  <%= will_paginate @jobs %>

  <% for job in @jobs %>
    <%= job[:jobtitle] %>
  <% end %>
